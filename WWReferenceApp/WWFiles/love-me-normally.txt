The Normal Album
Love, Me Normally
In lipstick on the mirror
Are the lyrics to my obituary
In iambic pentameter, followed parameter
Cross my eyes, dot my T's
I was delivered holding scissors
I live deliberately, I'm a quitter
And a winner anyway
'Cause I never agreed to participate in this game
Won't follow my dreams
No, they've all got me waking up screaming
I can let them go from me
After all, there's no "I" in team
And I'd rather be normal, yes, so normal
I suggest that we keep this informal
'Cause a normal human being wouldn't need
To pretend to be normal, to be normal
Well, I guess that's the least that I owe ya
To be normal in a way I couldn't be, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, and love me normally
If I could live in third person
Well, I don't think life would be much worse than it is
In the current tense, presently, this sentence ending with
Question marks or dot, dot, dot
Is it courageous or escapist
To leave the quarantine when you're contagious?
It may just be a cold
And besides I don't wanna get old, yeah
I drank myself to death
To be the afterlife of the party
When the after-party came
I was rolling in my grave!
And I'd rather be normal, yes, so normal
I suggest that we keep this informal
'Cause a normal human being wouldn't need
To pretend to be normal, to be normal
Well, I guess that's the least that I owe ya
To be normal in a way I couldn't be, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, and love me normally
Now this is the part of the song where I like to talk to my audience
I like to tell 'em there's something I want from you hep cats tonight
I want you to look to your left, look to your right
Your 12 o'clock, three o'clock, six o'clock, nine o'clock, rock around the clock tonight
And I want you to find those points of no return, those singularities
Those burning rings of fire in the beautiful pupils of the beautiful eyes of the beautiful
Boy, girl, neither, both, or in-between that you brought with you tonight
And I want you to tell 'em how you really feel
I want you to tell 'em that you love the way they so seamlessly, like-a-dream-fully
So beautifully, oh so dutifully
Jam that square peg in the round hole in their heart
I want you to tell 'em that you love the way
That they don't stick out like sore middle fingers
That they crawl their way up the side of the bell curve
Stick their flag in the peak, and slide their way back down
I want you to tell them that you love the way that they're not maladaptive
Not malcontent, not malignant or maleficent, but rather that you love them
Exactly the way that everybody else is!
I was nothing before
So I couldn't have asked to be born
I'll be nothing again
So what am I between now and then?
Is there nothing to fear?
'Cause shit's getting weird
So to God who made this man
You better have one hell of a plan
I'd rather be normal, yes, so normal
I suggest that we keep this informal
'Cause a normal human being wouldn't need, no
To pretend to be normal, to be normal
Well, I guess that's the least that I owe ya
To be normal in a way that I could never be
Yeah-ah-ah
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, I said c'mon, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, I said c'mon, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, and love me normally
Whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah-yeah, whoa, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, and love me
Normally
