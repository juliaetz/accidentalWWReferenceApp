The Normal Album
well, better than the alternative
Pink lemonade on autumn bomber coats
Peter Pan collars but my daughter's growing up
She's gonna be a lot like me
But I don't wanna be at all like me
Yellow buzzcuts, pulling out stingers
You're telling me I'm holding up eleven fingers and
Stranger things than death can happen
To lab rat girls and pretty white rabbits but
Everybody knows that nobody knows that
Everybody's in on everybody's business
This isn't my first Christmas
I know mistletoe when I see it
Baby, could you play along with me
Baby, would that be alright with you
And when we find out what's wrong with me
Could you tell me how I'm right for you
Baby, could you play along with me
Baby, would that be alright with you
And when we find out what's wrong with me
Could you tell me how could you tell me how
And if I'm still pretty
Cigarette burns, laugh lines, wide dimples
If they could see the future back when times were simple
Would they kiss your cheek or yank the bandage off
Let you speak or take advantage of how
If everyone's sick, well then nobody can catch it, and if
Everybody's different how could anybody match
And we're looking through the pockets of the hand-me-downs we've laid out
Wondering if we'll fit into the yesterdays we've played out
Everybody knows that nobody knows that
Everybody's all up in my goddamn business
This isn't my first kiss, it's better to be lost than
Loved, now, isn't it?
Baby, could you play along with me
Baby, would that be alright with you
And when we find out what's wrong with me
Could you tell me how I'm right for you
Baby, could you play along with me
Baby, would that be alright with you
And when we find out what's wrong with me
Could you tell me how could you tell me how
And if I'm still pretty
Walking bikes home with a scraped-knee sunset
Smudged across your brow
Warmer tears than you've grown used to since then
A toast to the nosebleed seats
And the big dream sequence where you're found
Guilty of your innocence and gently sent right back to bed
Everybody knows that nobody knows that
Everybody's all up in my motherfucking business
This isn't my first anything. This isn't my first anything
Everybody knows that nobody knows that
Everybody's in on everybody's business
This isn't my first lyric, I know exactly how I should finish it
Baby, could you play along with me
Baby, would that be alright with you
And when we find out what's wrong with me
Could you tell me how I'm right for you
Baby, could you play along with me
Baby, would that be alright with you
After all of that's been done to me
Could you tell me how could you tell me how
Could you tell me
What's so wrong about what's wrong with me
I'm just trying to do what's right by you
What's so wrong about what's wrong with me
I'm just trying to do what's right by you
Baby, could you play along with me
Baby, would that be alright with you
After all of that's been done with me
Could you tell me how could you tell me how
Could you tell me how
