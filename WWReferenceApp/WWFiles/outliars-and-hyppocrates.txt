The Normal Album
Outliars and Hyppocrates
Did you know that the hole in the apple didn't come from the outside in?
It was eaten from the core and out to the skin
And that's why you'll never find the worm in it
But a few bad ones won't spoil the eyes, if they fall far enough from the tree
The rind is all you see, leave Eden with my seeds in your stomach
Well, this disease is defined by its treatment, you people make me sick
Parlance of imbalanced, cambia's been challenged at best
AstraZeneca's just theoretical
Prints of your fingers in the Rorschach jigsaw, say you saw a treasure map
Straight-jacket and tie, psychiatric supply, while we tragically try to fit into a trap, but
Who'd want to be human anyway? (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
Who pilots all these crude machines?
Why'd you come into this world or come out that way?
Like freaks of nurture, well, isn't it funny?
(Well, not ha-ha funny, but y'know, funny)
'Cause I doubt that you would even if you could change
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange
I doubt that you would even if you could change
The things that make you special are the things that make you strange
I am the shadows cast aside by gallows, and you the red-hot sky
And if you're believers, then why would you grieve for the dead
Instead of a devil that you never prayed for?
You become immune to my toxic fumes
My dose-dependent presence in your life
It's all subjective, all due respect to the collective mind, but
Too weird to love, too scared to die (ay, ay, ay, ay), too alien to take you home
Horrified at the sight of my reflection in your eyes, I don't belong there
Well, it's your conclusions that make mine delusions, so I make you sane
You can thank me later
Well, I doubt that you would, even if you could change
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange
I doubt that you would, even if you could change
The things that make you special are the things that make you strange
Who'd want to belong to anyone? (Ay, ay, ay, ay) I mean, what do people even do?
So, if you love me, let me let you go, my love (ay, ay, ay, ay), so I can be no one
When Chuang-Tzu awoke, he sat up almost choking
Spat out a butterfly and said, "Five more minutes, please?
You wouldn't believe the dream I just had
I mean, you were there, and you were there
And you, and you, and you were there"
'Cause I doubt that you would, even if you could change
The things that make you special are what make you strange
I doubt that you would, even if you could change
The things that make you special are the same that make you
I doubt that you would even if you could change
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange
I doubt that you would even if you could change
The things that make you special are the same that make you strange
