The Normal Album
2econd 2ight 2eer
My grip on my secrets slipping while I'm speaking in tongues
Screaming at the top of my lungs in the confession booth
Take it with a pillar of salt, H.A.L.T., it's not my fault
The devil made me do it, but I also kinda wanted to
I'm cut from a different kind of meat
More than you can chew, hard to swallow me
Forget bored stiff, I got rigor mortis, call it morbid curiosity how I
Cannot commit to reality, when my third eye's open and I like what I see
Baby, I may be crazy but I didn't lose it, no I set it free
I can't ignore what's under dance floorboards
The rhythm of my heart a dead-as-disco beat
But I still move my feet to slip out of this groove, I'm free
Now, to row, row, row my boat over the falls
And maybe wake up from but a dream, yeah
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I didn't lose it babe, there wasn't much to find
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I'm only passing through
If you knew what I knew, if you saw what I see
You'd look through illusions, hallucinations, and lucid dream
And I know that meaning can be such a pretty thing to keep
But I got facts and I'm not afraid to use 'em
Take the good with the bad, take off the back you make a new front
Some days I'm glad that I am a madman and I'd rather be that than
An amicable animal, mild-mannered cannibal
But I'm more level-headed and clever than ever
And I'm getting better one forever at a time, and if
Sick is defined by what's different, well then pull the plug out and let me die
Vice-versa vice versus virtue, well who I am I choose through all the things I do
And if it rhymes, it's true. But I hate poetry
Now with my moral compass pointing south, going down
With no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no respect for reality
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I didn't lose it babe, there wasn't much to find
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I'm only passing through
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
I didn't lose it babe, there wasn't much to find
I'm just a psycho, babe. Come and go out my mind
A tourist passing through
Well that was fun, goodbye
